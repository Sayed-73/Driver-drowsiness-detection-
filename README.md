Driver drowsiness detection is a car safety technology which helps prevent accidents caused by the driver getting drowsy.

Core Steps in a Drowsiness Detection System :
Image/Video Acquisition: A camera (often near-infrared) mounted on the dashboard continuously captures video of the driver's face.
Face and Landmark Detection: Using tools like OpenCV and dlib, the system identifies the face in each frame and locates key landmarks, particularly the eyes and mouth.
Feature Extraction & Eye Tracking: The system calculates the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to determine if eyes are open or closed, and monitors for frequent yawning or head drooping.
Drowsiness Assessment (Classification): Machine learning algorithms or simple thresholding detect patterns (e.g., eyes closed for a specific number of frames), determining if the driver is fatigued.
Alert Mechanism: If drowsiness is detected, the system immediately triggers an audible alarm or visual warning to wake the driver.
